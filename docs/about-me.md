# About me

I'm Quang Hung. I live in Vietnam, 1 cat, 2 dogs and a whole lot of computers. I start my career as a backend Ruby developer in the late 2010's. At that moment, SPAs and microservices were becoming standard. With my curiosity, I simply adapted. I'm now quite comfortable in JavaScript or Python. I'm currently learning Golang.


### Companies I had worked

- 2014 - 2018: Hanoi University - Degree in Computer Science
- 2017 - 2020: Fullstack developer at Sun-asterisk inc.
- 2020 - 2021: Frontend developer at Kaopiz Software
- 2021 - 2023   Fullstack developer at XPON Technologies Group

`React` `Next` `NestJs` `Flask` `Django` `Ruby on Rails` `Git` `Docker` `AWS` `Electron` `Monorepo`


### Meaning of programing to me

Computers are awesome, but mostly a reflection of the people using them. In my coding adventure, I realised that learning to program is not simply learning how to code, but the art of crafting software behind it; thus, the human factor. My ideal of craftmanship is strongly influenced by Uncle Bob.

- In 2014, I spent 4 years at a univeristy learning about computer science. I started coding with Java and was getting familiar with Object Oriented Programming. However, applying the concepts into practice was still a chalenge. "Clean Code" was my guide line.

- In 2018, I started my internship as a Ruby developer. Relised that applying concept of OOP into language was not a strict procedure. Applying both OOP and functional programming in different aspect of software was an amazing experience. "99 bottles of OOP", written by Sandi Metz was my favorite.

- In 2019, most of my work was migrating legacy system which were Rails monolithics to microservices re-written in Python; and rewrote UI with React. Thus, becoming a fullstack developer. "You Don't Know Javascript" was my personal recommendation.

- In 2021, Typescript and its ecosystem was reached it maturity. Adapting it was not a question anymore. I also became seriously with cloud computing.
